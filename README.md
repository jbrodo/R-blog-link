# Link Tank
I decided to write this list of useful links about [R](https://www.r-project.org/), since I have reached "the point of no return" of opened tabs in Google Chrome and I cannot buy a new monitor. However, I decided to create a my personal tank of useful links.

  + [Best websites a programmer should visit (sdmg15)](https://github.com/sdmg15/Best-websites-a-programmer-should-visit)

  + [Awesome Software Engineer Topics (voxsim)](https://github.com/voxsim/awesome-software-engineer-topics)
  
  + [Free Programmig Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)

  + [Link Tank about R](r-link.md)

  + [Link Tank about LateX](latex-link.md)
